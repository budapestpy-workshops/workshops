# Scikit-learn intro

## Scikit-learn Bank notes dataset
The notebook is an introduction to the scikit learn library. This is one of the most liked Machine Learning library for Python. We worked
with the Bank notes dataset, which contains data of authentic, and inauthentic data, and our task is to train a classification model, which
can predict the authenticity. 
The notebook uses many classification models, so we can compare them:
- Logistic regression
- Decision tree
- Random forest
- Support Vector Machines
- XGBoost

Other methods used:
- Cross validation
- Grid Search
- Confusion matrix
- Classification report
