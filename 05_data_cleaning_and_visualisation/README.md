# Data Cleaning and Visualisation

**Data_Cleaning_bppy notebook** (Balazs Balogh's part):
This is the complete notebook about data cleaning with Pandas. We have two examples, one is the gapminder dataset, which holds the life expectancy of every countries from 1800 to 2016. This is a messy, and untidy dataset originally, but with Pandas' data cleaning functions we clean it, and tidy it.
The second example is the tips dataset, intentionally ruined, so we can clean it. It holds more than two hundred rows, with bills, tips, day of the dinner or lunch, and so on. We used pandas' to_numeric, get_dummies, drop, replace functions among the "usual" ones. LabelEncoding and One-Hot Encoding was also introduced. What is the difference between the two, and when to use which (with wrong examples to make it more clear).

**data_cleaning_bppy_ws notebook** (Balazs Balogh's part):
The same notebook as the previous, expect it has some holes in the tips dataset solution, to do a live coding at the event. The gapminder part is the same.

**workshop5_visualization** (Miklós Doma's part):
Get to know Bokeh better with a nifty visualisation of time series as the third dimension. We investigate the correlation between current health expenditure and the life expectancy at birth for every continent.


**DataCleaning files** (Bertalan Rónai's part) : 
First, download Microsoft Power BI from the Microsoft store or from powerbi.com. Then check out the PowerPoint presentation, the source excel file and the Power BI file.
