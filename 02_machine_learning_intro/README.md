# Machine Learning intro

There are two notebooks in the folder. One is the full version of a musical recommender system. We have two datasets, one is around 2900 rows with the users, the play count, and the artist's id. The other contains the artist names. We learned to use pandas pivot function, the csr_matrix, and the NMF (Non-negative Matrix Factorization) and two scaling methods. You can choose an artist from the given list, and the result is a list of the recommended artists based on the user play counts.

There's another version of this notebook, the "WS" one, which has some deleted pieces, for working together.
