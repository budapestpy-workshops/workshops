How to download and run Jupyter Notebooks from GitHub:
- Go into the repo where you want to download the notebook.
- Right click on the notebook "Save link as" or "Link mentése más néven".
- Copy it to your Anaconda root folder, which by default your User folder in Windows.
- Now you can go to http://localhost:8888/tree, and browse for the file.

Or you can click the green "Clone or Download" button, and download a ZIP file to your Anaconda folder (by default, your User folder), unpack it, then look for it at http://localhost:8888/tree.

How to install libraries in Anaconda:

Go to your Anaconda Prompt and put in the install command. The example is for folium (a data visualisation library):
Google the "conda install folium" command - usually this is the exact command you will give. But in this case, you get the standard anaconda.org page (https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/folium), where you can find that the command here is "conda install -c conda-forge folium".
